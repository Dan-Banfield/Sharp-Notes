## About The Project

![Sharp Notes Showcase](https://github.com/Dan-Banfield/Sharp-Notes/blob/master/Images/Sharp%20Notes%20Showcase.png?raw=true)

The Windows notepad is great; however, I didn't find a lot of the features that I found essential, such as: code highlighting, ease of access, etc. So, I wanted to create a better version of the Windows notepad. -- I think this is it ;).
